        <p>
            This is a very simple app that uses basic physics to tell you the height of a cliff or the depth of a well. All you do is time how long it takes for the object to hit the ground and let science do the rest. You can even measure the height of a cliff from the ground if you throw a rock right up to the top and start timing at the apex.

            This app was inspired by Science/Design/Creativity YouTuber Mark Rober.
